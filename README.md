This is the repository for the ISCA 2025 accepted paper Zettafly. Currently, this repository only provides the conference slides.

Since the results in the paper are based on our self-developed simulator, which we currently do not plan to open-source, I am unable to share the code for Zettafly. However, the experiments with synthesized workloads in the paper can be reproduced using common credit-based flow control simulators, such as Booksim.

If you have any further questions or would like to discuss anything with me, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me directly at: wangziyu@nudt.edu.cn
